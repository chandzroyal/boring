    <h1>My life</h1>
    <p>My name is Devesh Chand and I was born on November 15 2008, Fiji, Suva Hospital. When I was about 4-7 years old, I lived with my Grandma and auntie until I moved to New Zealand.</p>
    <p>When I moved to New Zealand I was 7 years old and my first memory i had in New Zealand was eating KFC at night I came.

At the age of 13, I enrolled into this school (Otahuhu College) and had fun in this school for the past 2 years.</p>

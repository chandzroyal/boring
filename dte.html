    <h1>What I do in class</h1>
    <p>In my class there is our wonderful teacher, Mr Morales and roughly 30 student. In my classroom I sit at the front row, across me there was a guy named Arnav but he got moved cause he was a bad boy and now theres a girl named Avni who sits there.</p> 
	<p>Next to Avni there is a wild monkey named Nirav who likes eating bananas who sits there and next to me there's a guy named Rahil who is short but cute at the same time. For the past two terms we have been doing inkscape, blender, pyhton coding and now website design.</p>
